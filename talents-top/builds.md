# 10.1.5 Builds

- _Last Updated_: 8/7/2023 - Update from recent hotfixes. Almost every build adjusted.
- _Last Updated_: 6/30/2023 - Update Y'Shaarj Dungeon build and adjust average numbers for dungeons.

# Single Target
If you can make it work, Dark Ascension can net you about 2% DPS over Void Eruption builds in single target. This number can vary based on movement, specifically during cooldowns. Voidform giving you access to Void Bolt
gives you a considerable edge when handling movement during cooldowns, whereas Dark Ascension is more turret. We provide top builds for both in case you want one vs. the other for that reason.

## Dark Ascension
Can flex points between Mind Devourer or Phantasmal Pathogen.

## Void Eruption
Can still use Mind's Eye if you prefer, its within marginal DPS of Distorted Reality. For many people Distorted Reality will make the spec easier to play. You can use either of the two builds depending on what you prefer, they are very close together/similar.

# Single Target + Shadow Crash
If you are looking to do maximum single target while still taking Shadow Crash and Whispering Shadows here are the top builds for Dark Ascension and Void Eruption. Generally speaking the Dark Ascension version will be much more performant.

# Dungeon Builds
With our dungeon builds you generally have 4-5 flex points that you can spend on a variety of options depending on if you want more single target, aoe, or overall damage. The builds below pick the mix of flex points that generically perform the best across a variety of keys, but feel free to experiment with these.

## Flex Points
Roughly listed in order of damage value.

- Mind Devourer - Overall (good with Distorted Reality)
- Phantasmal Pathogen - Overall
- Dark Evangelism - Overall
- Maddening Touch - Overall
- Mental Decay - Single Target
- Mental Fortitude - Defensive
- Silence - Utility

## Build Options
In addition to Flex points you can also choose to run Distorted Reality (DR) or Mind's Eye (ME). DR builds offer 2-4% more overall damage compared to ME builds, but you lose out on the priority target damage. Pick whichever feels more comfortable for you or how you want to build.

Note that with Distorted Reality you should _spread_ Devouring Plague on AoE to targets that will live for at least a few seconds. You should still be hitting targets with Devouring Plague but by
spreading it you can increase overall damage.

Mind's Eye is still a great option since it offers more priority target damage. You can still play for priority
target damage on a pack-by-pack basis with Distorted Reality as it is only 2-3% behind in terms of overall when you play like that. Distorted Reality will also give you an option for 2-target priority damage that Mind's Eye cannot. Every build listed below can run with either choice.

Rough numbers:
- Distorted Reality builds are 4% more overall damage on average than Mind's Eye when spreading Devouring Plague
- Distorted Reality and Mind's Eye are within margin of each other on Single Target
- Mind's Eye is roughly 3% more overall compared to Distorted Reality if you are playing both as full-funnel builds in AoE and never spreading Devouring Plague

## Single Target Breakdown
This chart is showing how much single target DPS you can perform with the various builds. This is intended to help make the decision of sacrificing single target for overall easier.
